## Overview

The Smart Thermostat is an IoT-based system that adapts to outdoor temperature changes.  
It connects to the internet, reads real-time weather data (or sensor data), and adjusts heating or cooling using a simple level-based logic.

When it’s cold, the thermostat **levels up** to increase indoor temperature.  
When it’s warm, it **levels down** to save energy.
